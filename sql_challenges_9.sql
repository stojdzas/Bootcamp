HOW TO GET THE SCHEMA OF A DATABASE:

previous SQL Challenges, plus the following clauses:
    - AS
	- LEFT JOIN
    - RIGHT JOIN
    - INNER JOIN
*/

USE publications; 
 
/*******************************************************************************
ALIAS (AS) for tables
*******************************************************************************/

/* 1. Select the table sales, assigning the alias "s" to it. 
   Select the column ord_num using the syntax "table_alias.column" */

SELECT s.ord_num
FROM sales AS s;

You do not need to worry about the other types for now
